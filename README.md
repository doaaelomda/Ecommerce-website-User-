# ECommerce
•	I build this project by HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, TypeScript, Angular and Api  The website is 2 -pages(Products and Carts)    
•	The problems I faced in this application:   
I displayed the products using the API, created an environment folder and  created  a variable  with  the  value of 'https://fakestoreapi.com'.    Then, I created a service and assigned some functions to it to use the API link to display multiple product links and categories. I used the same link but with different endpoints to display individual products and categories.
